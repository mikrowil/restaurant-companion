This is a personal project for demonstrating my knowledge in PHP.  

Hello my name is michael wilson.
This is a test project for demonstrating some of my knowledge in programming, mostly PHP.

* Some of the technologies used are:
	* MySQL
	* Authentication
	* Password hashing
	* Data layer abstraction
	* GET / POST requests and Form verification
	* User sessions 

* Instructions to run:
	* Xampp is required to run this project locally for testing.
	* To install xamp, [click here](https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html)
	* Place the project folder inside of htdocs in the xampp folder.
	* The address on a local machine will be "http://localhost/portfolio/index.php".
	* Now install mysql if you do not have it yet. For instructions [click here](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-installation-excerpt/5.7/en/installing.html)
	* Make sure the config.js has the correct addresses for the api as well as the DB info.
	* To set up the db run "Type db.sql | mysql -u root -p.
	* When creating the database use the name "RESTAURANTS".(If you would like to change the name, make sure to change it from the sql file in the project)
