This is a personal project for demonstrating my knowledge in PHP.  

Hello my name is michael wilson.
This is a test project for demonstrating some of my knowledge in programming, mostly PHP.

Some of the technologies used are:
				- MySQL
        - Authentication
        - Password hashing
        - Data layer abstraction
        - GET / POST requests and Form verification
        - User sessions 

Instructions to run:
        Xampp is required to run this project locally for testing.
	Place the project folder inside of htdocs in the xampp folder.
	Address on a local machine will be "http://localhost/portfolio/index.php"
        Make sure the config.js has the correct addresses for the api as well as the DB info
        To set up the db run "Type db.sql | mysql -u root -p
        Then press enter. (Mysql must be installed on your machine for this to work)
        When creating the database use the name "RESTAURANTS"
