This is a personal project for demonstrating my knowledge in PHP.  

Hello my name is michael wilson.
This is a test project for demonstrating some of my knowledge in programming, mostly PHP.

Some of the technologies used are:
				- MySQL
        - Authentication
        - Password hashing
        - Data layer abstraction
        - GET / POST requests and Form verification
        - User sessions 

Instructions to run:
        Xampp is required to run this project locally for testing.
        Make sure the config.js has the correct addresses for the api as well as the DB info
        To set up the db run "Type db.sql | mysql -u root -p
        Then press enter. (Mysql must be installed on your machine for this to work)
